🚀 InternPe Java Internship Project 🚀
🔮 Can You Guess the Number?

Just built a Guess the Number game in Java during my internship at InternPe !

🎯 The game picks a secret number — your mission? Guess it!
🔑 Get hints like "Too high!" or "Too low!"
⏱ See how many attempts you take to crack the code!

Simple, addictive, and a perfect way to sharpen Java skills!
Drop a comment if you want the code or try the challenge yourself!
